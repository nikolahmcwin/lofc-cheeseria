# POC for a cheeseria called Lovers of Fine Cheese (lofc)

A simple web application to show case cheeses

## Overview

### Tech used

- Node.js with Express (setup manually)
- Swagger
- React with React Router (setup with Vite)
- Jest and SuperTest

### Project purpose

Built to show working code across a few layers without being a fully fledged solution. My biggest focuses were:

1. Getting it working
2. Keeping it simple
3. Using time efficiently
4. Learning what/why as I go

### Running the app

- Back-end ''
- Front-end ''
- Or use the docker file.

## Time put in

I set my own deadline of completing and handing in by EOD Thursday, and worked in order of priority against this draft:

- Mon: Set up, learn Node.js, learn Swagger, start back-end API
- Tue: Finish API, test, design front-end, learn React
- Wed: Build front-end, style, test comprehensively
- Thu: Polish up, improve documentation, unit tests, docker file

## Final word

For this project, I considered myself a student web developer.

I am currently on an ongoing upskilling journey to expand my programming skills, catch-up in modern tech, and get my career back on track with my goals, and I've been tracking this against an informal study plan.

When I first opened the brief, I honestly didn't consider myself far enough through the plan to be able to complete the project. However, even while trying to keep a reasonable time check on myself, I found this surprisingly more straightforward and enjoyable than I expected. Every step that came together felt like such a personal win.

Thank you for the fantastic opportunity and fun concept to show myself I can do it. Nothing like just jumping in and getting started to finally cross that line and build something. A web developer in-training is still a web developer, as long as you're developing!
