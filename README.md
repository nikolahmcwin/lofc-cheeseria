# Basic web app POC for a cheeseria called LoFC, Lovers of Fine Cheese!

## Junior full stack development project

Built to show working code across a few layers without being a fully fledged solution. My biggest focuses were:

1. Getting it working
2. Keeping it simple
3. Using time efficiently
4. Learning what/why as I go

### Tech stack used

- Node.js with Express (setup manually)
- Swagger
- React with React Router (setup with Vite)
- Jest and SuperTest

## Foreword

I am currently undertaking an ongoing upskilling journey to expand my programming skills, catch-up in modern tech, and get my career back on track with my goals.

For the purposes of this project, let's consider me a student web developer. A web developer in-training, if I may.

While I have a study plan I've been following recently, this project required me to skip a few "modules" in the middle to get things working, and I fear I skimmed over a few important learning moments. I will get back to those shortly as learning the why and the good practices is important to me.

For now, please enjoy my first application of the tech I had only previously dabbled in. And regardless of the outcome, thank you for the fantstic opportunity and fun concept to throw everything together and finally cross that line and show myself I can do it. A student developer is still a developer!
