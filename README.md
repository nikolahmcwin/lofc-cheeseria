# POC for a cheeseria called Lovers of Fine Cheese (lofc)

A simple web application to show case 5 cheeses you can buy on-site in the cheeseria store.

## Overview

### Tech used

- Node.js with Express (setup manually)
- Swagger
- React with React Router (setup with Vite)
- Jest and SuperTest

### Project purpose

Built to show working code across a few layers without being a fully fledged solution. My biggest focuses were:

1. Getting it working
2. Keeping it simple
3. Using time efficiently
4. Learning what/why as I go

The assumptions I made here:
- Back end needed full CRUD methods
- Swagger for all
- Front end was OK to only display for now (no updates/deletes etc)
- Unit tests for a handful of methods as an example

### Running the app

This was weirdly the part of the project I found most difficult to finish (well, the dev vs prod of it).

For the 'prod' version with docker compose (if I did get that right.....)

- docker compose up --build


If all else fails, in dev I've been using:

- ./backend   npm run devStart
- ./frontend   npm run dev

## Time put in

I set my own deadline of completing and handing in by the first weekend, and worked in order of priority against this draft:

- Mon: Set up, learn Node.js, learn Swagger, start back-end API
- Tue: Finish API, test, design front-end, learn React
- Wed: Build front-end, style, test comprehensively
- Thu: Polish up, improve documentation, unit tests, docker file
- Fri: Docker compose, finalise repo, submit

## Final word

For this project, I considered myself a student web developer.

I am currently on an ongoing upskilling journey to expand my programming skills, catch-up in modern tech, and get my career back on track with my goals, and I've been tracking this against an informal study plan.

When I first opened the brief, I honestly didn't consider myself far enough through the plan to be able to complete the project. However, even while trying to keep a reasonable time check on myself, I found this surprisingly more straightforward and enjoyable than I expected. Every step that came together felt like such a huge personal win.

Thank you for the fantastic opportunity and fun concept to show myself I can do it. Nothing like just jumping in and getting started to finally cross that line and put that theory into action by just building something. A web developer in-training is still a web developer, as long as you're developing! I do however, promise to go back and catchup on the fundamentals I skimmed over in the rush to get this going. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
